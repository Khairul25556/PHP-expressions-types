//Abstract class = common logic(shared) + force child to complete some parts.
//Interface = only force structure, no logic allowed.

//Abstract classes cannot be used directly.
//You must create a child class that extends the abstract class.
//Only the child class can create an object

//BASE INTERFACE (structure only, no logic)

//concrete class - that means it implements all the interface and abstract method. By extending the online payment processor it actually also implements that interface. So this is all inherited
//CHILD CLASS (concrete, fully working class)

        return strpos($this->apikey, 'sk_')===0; //strpos menas string position. api key 'sk' position is 0 then it would be true. so like abc_sk_123. here sk position 4. so 4 != 0
    }

//CHILD CLASS (concrete, fully working class)
class PayPalProcessor extends OnlinePaymentProcessor{ // ðŸŸ¢ CHILD
    protected function validateApiKey(): bool{
        return strlen($this->apikey) === 32;

// Creating an object from the CHILD class
